# These are my solutions to the Advent of Code December 2024 Challenge! 
### Each folder will be named in 'XY' day format (from '01' to '25') of the challenge.
### In each folder, there will be a data.txt file for the problem input, part1.py script for solution to part1, and similarly with part2.py script.
### This challenge is just for fun, and I will be recording my solutions on YouTube over at: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7SmoyT9-7xme5YQq8flPb8r8O-ajxure&si=tQ-Nk73w553f-aQQ.
