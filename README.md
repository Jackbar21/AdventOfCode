# These are my solutions to the Advent of Code December Challenges by year!

### Each folder will be named corresponding to the challenge's year.

### Each yearly-subfolder will be named in 'XY' day format (from '01' to '25') of the challenge.

### In each such folder, there will be a data.txt file for the problem input, part1.py script for solution to part1, and similarly with part2.py script. There is often a test_data.txt file, for the example sample input for testing purposes.

### This challenge is just for fun, and I will be recording my solutions on YouTube for 2024 over at: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7SmoyT9-7xme5YQq8flPb8r8O-ajxure&si=tQ-Nk73w553f-aQQ.

### There is also a setup.py file at the root of the project, used to setup the afore-mentioned file structure for the given year.
